**README: MANAL'S CALCULATOR WEB APPI!**


*1. HOW DID I BUILD THE APP?*
	
	Upon wishing to follow a more visual approach to learning C#,I decided to build a simple calculator web application using ASP.NET Core.
	I started by creating a new ASP.NET Core Web App project in Visual Studio. 

	I divided the project into three main components: the user interface (UI), the business logic, and the data handling. How? Well by doing the following:	
		1. I created a separate project for the Server (RESTFUL API) 
		2. And another one for the Client (API REST WEB WITH MVC).

	PIPELINE:

		A. Welcome page that introduces our calculator and its features along with a simple registering options should the user wish to have access to the journal of their calculations.
		B. The main page with an intuitive menu that allows users to select the type of calculation they want to perform (e.g., basic arithmetic, scientific calculations, etc.).
		C. A separate page for each type of calculation, where users can input their numbers and select the desired operation.
		D. A separate page for access to the journal of calculations for registered users. (In order to access it, users must go back to the menu)
		
		SERVER:
	Here is where I defined the app's logic.
